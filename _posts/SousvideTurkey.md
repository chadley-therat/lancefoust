# Chadley Therat, a House Husband's Sous Vide Turkey - An Honored Gift

Hello everyone! Today, we're tackling a special recipe: a Sous Vide Turkey, a recently received gift from my mother-in-law. It's an honor to receive such a gift, and I'm excited to share with you the love and care I put into preparing this bird.

## The Main Event: Sous Vide Turkey

First, let's talk about the star of our show: the turkey. Cooking a turkey sous vide style ensures that every part of the bird is cooked perfectly, and finishing it in a high-temp oven gives it a beautifully crisp skin. Here's what you need:

- 1 whole turkey, separated into parts
- Assorted spices (salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary)
- Olive oil
- Turkey gravy, for serving

Start by seasoning the turkey parts with your assorted spices. Don't be shy with the seasonings - they'll infuse the meat with flavor as it cooks. Once seasoned, vacuum-seal each part using a vacuum chamber sealer. This step is crucial for sous vide cooking, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed during the cooking process.

Next, it's time to cook our turkey parts sous vide. Choose the desired temperature and cooking time based on your preferred doneness:

- Very pink, soft, extra-moist: Bath Temp: 132°F (56°C), Core Temp: 130°F (55°C), Cook Time: 4 hours
- Pale pink, soft, moist: Bath Temp: 138°F (59°C), Core Temp: 136°F (58°C), Cook Time: 3 hours
- White, tender, moist: Bath Temp: 145°F (63°C), Core Temp: 130°F (55°C), Cook Time: 2 1/2 hours
- White, traditional roast texture: Bath Temp: 152°F (67°C), Core Temp: 150°F (66°C), Cook Time: 2 hours

## The Finishing Touch: Crisp Skin

Once your turkey parts are cooked sous vide, it's time to give them that beautiful, crispy skin. Preheat your oven to a high temperature (around 500°F), brush your turkey parts with olive oil, and roast until the skin is golden brown and crispy. The contrast between the tender meat and the crispy skin will be heavenly.

Finally, serve your turkey with some homemade turkey gravy. The gravy adds an extra layer of flavor and makes the dish even more comforting.
