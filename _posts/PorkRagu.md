# Chadley Therat, a House Husband's Slow-Cooked Pork Ragu with Fresh Pasta

Hello everyone! Today, we're going to tackle a recipe that's close to my heart: Slow-Cooked Pork Ragu with Fresh Pasta. As a former yakuza turned domestic god, I know a thing or two about taking time and care to make something truly special. And trust me, this dish is worth every minute.

## The Main Event: Pork Ragu

First, let's talk about the star of our show: the slow-cooked pork ragu. This dish requires patience, but trust me, your efforts will be rewarded. Here's what you need:

- 2 lb bone-in pork shoulder blade roast
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme

Start by seasoning the pork shoulder with salt and pepper, then sear it in a hot pot with olive oil. Once it's browned, set it aside and saut√© your onion, carrots, and celery until softened. Add your minced garlic and let everything get acquainted in the pot.

Next, deglaze your pot with red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. These bits are like little flavor bombs, and you don't want to miss out on that! Add your crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, and thyme, and nestle your pork shoulder back into the pot, welcoming it back into the flavor party.

Now, here's where the patience comes in. Cover your pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 3-4 hours. Trust the process; the low and slow approach will result in pork that's so tender, it practically shreds itself.

## Handmade Touch: Fresh Pasta

While your ragu is simmering away, it's time to turn your attention to the fresh pasta. There's something satisfying about making pasta from scratch - it's a little bit of work, but the difference in taste and texture is undeniable. You'll need:

- 400 grams 00 flour
- 4 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

Combine your flour and salt, create a well in the middle, and crack your eggs into it. Gradually incorporate the flour as you beat the eggs, and knead until you have a smooth dough. Remember, this is a labor of love, so take your time.

Once your dough is ready, roll it out and cut it into your preferred pasta shape. I like to use a classic tagliatelle, but feel free to get creative!

## The Grand Finale

Once your pork is tender and your pasta is cut, it's time to bring it all together. Shred your pork, discarding any fat or bone, and stir it back into the sauce. Cook your pasta until it's perfectly al dente, then toss it in the ragu.

Serve your masterpiece with a sprinkle of Parmesan and some fresh basil leaves. Sit back, enjoy the fruits of your labor, and bask in the accolades of your fellow diners. You've earned it!

## Bonus: Storing and Reheating

If you have leftovers (and trust me, this is a big 'if'), store your ragu and pasta separately in the fridge. To reheat, warm the ragu over medium heat and reheat the pasta in boiling water or the microwave.

## Nutritional Values
